# Spotifycmd
Tiny scripts for controlling Spotify on the command line

<b>To use:</b>
<code>sudo apt-get install xdotool</code>

I search for the Spotify process by name by doing <code>xdotool search --name "Spotify - Linux Preview"</code>. You might need to change this depending on whether you're a Premium user or not.


<code>prev</code> -- Go to previous song. I usually do this if I want to "repeat" a song without wilst skipping the commercial.

<code>pause</code> -- Play/pause the current song.
